        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability
          of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this
          Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
          limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100
          USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
          the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
          indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
          limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other
          information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of
          privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or
          inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party

          advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy
          fails of its essential purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
          limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which
          means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these
          states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent
          permitted by law.
        </p>
        <h2>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h2>

          The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS
          AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects without warranty of
          any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the
          Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and
          their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims
          all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with
          respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of
          merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
          non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of
          dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without
          limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or
          undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service
          will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be
          compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or
          services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or
          reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects
          can or will be corrected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
          company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
          express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
          Service, or the information, content, and materials or products
          included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or
          error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any
          information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the
          Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf

          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
          warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
          consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
          not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
          set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
          enforceable under applicable law.
